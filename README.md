3. Estimating Centre of the dustbin using the color segmented upper rim
4. Estimating centre of the dustbin using extreme points
5. Also a comparison table of the different methods
Results and data are contained in the subfolders.

The folder, Weekly reports : It contains all the reports I had done for presenting it during the weekly meets, which gives in depth theoretical explaantion.
